## Code to randomly assign to stakeholder groups

```{r}
# SOME CODE TO GENERATE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS

# FIRST SET A SEED SO WILL NOT CHANGE
set.seed(8433)

class<-data.frame(
   first=c('Carolina', 'Terrel', 'Stephen', 'Giancarlo', 'Daniel', 'Mariela', 'Chelsea', 'Emmet', 'Bryant', 'Hunter', 'Matthew', 'Johannah', 'Leah', 'Marian', 'Ciera', 'Michael', 'Bradley', 'Andrew', 'Andrew', 'Shannon', 'Treyvon'),
   last = c('Baruzzi','Christie', 'Clements', 'Coppola', 'Firth', 'Gantchoff', 'Gilliland', 'Guy', 'Haley', 'Hatcher', 'Ivey', 'Mccollum', 'Moran', 'Morris', 'Rhodes', 'Rhodes', 'Richardson', 'Shamaskin', 'Smith', 'Westlake', 'Strange'))

# how many in class?
nrow(class)
 
```
There are 21 folks in class, Lets assign 5 groups, 4 groups of 4 and 1 group of 5. 

```{r}
# make vector of stakeholders
stakeholder<- c("Animal welfare organizations (eg PETA)",
    "Concerned members of the general public",
    "N-G conservation organizations (eg TNC)",
    "Local animal control authority",
"Representatives from local governments",
    "State and local wildlife management agencies")

```
Now assign group to person in class which can be done by shuffling the vector.

```{r}
# Shuffle the vector of groups and assign to class group

class$group<- sample(stakeholder,21,replace=TRUE)
class
```
Would be much easier if it was sorted by group, right?

```{r}
class<- class[order(class$group),]
class
```
Much better.
