## Announcements

* Read Bieber, C., and T. Ruf. 2005. Population dynamics in wild boar 
_Sus scrofa_: ecology, elasticity of growth rate and implications for the 
management of pulsed resource consumers. Journal 
of Applied Ecology 42:1203-1213. [pdf](pdfs/B268.pdf)
* Guidance about the final project is posted here [here](final-project.html)
* In part II of homework 3 do not use `expand.grid()`
be sure to use `data.frame` instead to make `outcomes`
as `expand.grid()` will try to make all possible combinations
of the values you feed it.  If you give it 50k values that 
ends up being gigabytes of combinations! [here](hw-03.html)
