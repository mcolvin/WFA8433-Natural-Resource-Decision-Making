# Population dynamics & decisions

## Overview

In many cases we as scientists use tools like matrix population models
to understand how demographic rates interact and influence long term population
dynamics.  This is, at times, in conflict with management, where management may
take a long term view for sustainability but needs to make decisions right now to 
meet management objectives. 

Here we will walk through an analysis of boar dynamics. The analysis itself is 
done well, however we will see it is difficult to use this type of analysis to 
make decisions. To be clear there is nothing wrong with the study but rather we are 
looking at how one could use this type of analysis to make decisions and maybe take
a different view.

The life cycle of the boar is illustrated below, which can be crafted into a 
matrix model. This study is pretty neat because it deals with demographics that
are dependent on conditions (i.e., poor, intermediate, good). The P parameters represent
transition probabilities, incorporating growth and survival as a simultaneous process.
The F parameters represent fertilities. 


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("media/class-19/lifecycle.png")
```
The circles represent stages: juvenile, yearling, and adult. Note there are
3 stages modeled and therefore the transition matrix should be a 3x3 matrix.
The figure above can be represented as the matrix below:

$$\mathbf{A} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
F_1   & F_2  & F_3 \\
P_1   & 0     & 0 \\
0       & P_2     & P_3
\end{array}\right]
$$.

In poor conditions we can represent the demographic matrix as:


$$\mathbf{A_{poor}} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
0.13    & 0.56  & 1.64 \\
0.25    & 0     & 0 \\
0       & 0.31     & 0.58
\end{array}\right]
$$

and code it up on R as

```{r}
A_poor<- matrix(c(
    0.13, 0.56, 1.64,
    0.25,0,0,
    0, 0.31, 0.58),nrow=3, ncol=3,
    byrow=TRUE)
A_poor  
```
Similarly we can represent intermediate conditions as

$$\mathbf{A_{intermediate}} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
0.26   & 0.94  & 1.93 \\
0.33    & 0     & 0 \\
0       & 0.40     & 0.66
\end{array}\right]
$$

in matrix notation and coded up as


```{r}
A_intermediate<- matrix(c(
    0.26, 0.94, 1.93,
    0.33,0,0,
    0, 0.4, 0.66),nrow=3, ncol=3,
    byrow=TRUE)
A_intermediate   
```
Lastly we code up the good conditions demographic matrix as notation 
$$\mathbf{A_{good}} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
0.59  & 1.76  & 2.29 \\
0.52   & 0     & 0 \\
0       & 0.60     & 0.71
\end{array}\right]
$$

and code

```{r}
A_good<- matrix(c(
    0.59, 1.76, 2.29,
    0.52,0,0,
    0, 0.6, 0.71),nrow=3, ncol=3,
    byrow=TRUE)
A_good   
```

Good, we got the demographic matrices put together and we can potentially use that
information to make management decisions.

### Forecasting population dynamics

We can use matrix multiplication to easily forecast population dynamics given the 
demographic matrix and a vector of abundances for each stage.

$$\mathbf{N_{t+1}} = \left[\begin{array}
{rrr}
F_1   & F_2  & F_3 \\
P_1   & 0     & 0 \\
0       & P_2     & P_3
\end{array}\right] \cdot
\left[\begin{array}{r}N_{juvenile} \\N_{Yearling} \\N_{Adult} \end{array}\right] 
$$

We already have the transition matrices coded up ($A$) but we need a vector
of stage specific abundances to get the dynamics going. Here we assume that
we have 100 juveniles, 20 yearlings, and 50 adult boars. 

```{r}
N<- c(100,20,50) # STAGE SPECIFIC ABUNDANCE
```

Now we need to specify how many years to run out the population, let's do 20.

```{r}
years<- 20
```

Now we can set up a 3x20 matrix to hold our population abundances in for 
the forecast and we set the initial abundance to our vector of abundances.
```{r}
# A MATRIX TO HOLD ABUNDANCES
output<- matrix(0,3, years)
output[,1]<- N
```
Now we can use our old friend the for loop to forcast the dynamics.
Note the use of `i-1` and we are going from 2 to 20. That is because we 
have already set year 1 to the intial abundance.

```{r}
for(i in 2:years)
    {
    # SOME MATRIX MULTIPLICATION MAGIC
    output[,i]<- A_poor %*% output[,i-1]  
    }
```
We can use `matplot()` to easily plot the dynamics of the population given poor conditions.

```{r}
matplot(t(output),type='l',
    xlab="Years",
    ylab="Abundance",
    main="Poor conditions")
legend("topright",legend=c("Juvenile",
    "Yearling","Adult"),
    lty=c(1,2,3), 
    col=c("black","red","green"))
```
We can redo the same process for intermediate conditions.

```{r}
N<- c(100,20,50) # STAGE SPECIFIC ABUNDANCE
years<- 20
# A MATRIX TO HOLD ABUNDANCES
output<- matrix(0,3, years)
output[,1]<- N
for(i in 2:years)
    {
    # SOME MATRIX MULTIPLICATION MAGIC
    output[,i]<- A_intermediate %*% output[,i-1]  
    }
matplot(t(output),type='l',
    xlab="Years",
    ylab="Abundance",
    main="Intermediate conditions")
legend("topleft",legend=c("Juvenile",
    "Yearling","Adult"),
    lty=c(1,2,3), 
    col=c("black","red","green"))
```

And finally, we can redo the same process for good conditions.

```{r}
N<- c(100,20,50) # STAGE SPECIFIC ABUNDANCE
years<- 20
# A MATRIX TO HOLD ABUNDANCES
output<- matrix(0,3, years)
output[,1]<- N
for(i in 2:years)
    {
    # SOME MATRIX MULTIPLICATION MAGIC
    output[,i]<- A_good %*% output[,i-1]  
    }
matplot(t(output),type='l',
    xlab="Years",
    ylab="Abundance",
    main="Good conditions")
legend("topleft",legend=c("Juvenile",
    "Yearling","Adult"),
    lty=c(1,2,3), 
    col=c("black","red","green"))
```

### Growth rate, Sensitivity & Elasticity

#### Growth Rate: Lambda

One neat thing from the transition matrix is that you can do an eigen analysis
and figure out if the population is growing or not, a value referred to as lambda ($\lambda$).

```{r}
lambda_poor<-eigen(A_poor)$values[1]
lambda_poor<-Re(lambda_poor)# convert from imaginary
```
That was a lot of work to get the $\lambda$. The `popbio` package has functions
that will do this heavy lifting for us, `lambda()` specifically. 

```{r}
library("popbio")
lambda_poor
lambda(A_poor)
```
Ohhh, that does not look good for that population

```{r}
lambda_intermediate<- lambda(A_intermediate)
lambda_good<- lambda(A_good)
```
That jives with the paper results in table 3 below. But keep in mind that $\lambda$ 
represents long term population growth and is not dependeng on initial abundances!

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="50%", fig.align="center"}
include_graphics("media/class-19/paper-results.png")
```

#### Sensitivity: s

Matrix population models are commonly used to identify management strategies by 
performing a sensitivity analysis of the transition matrix. Matrix values with a
high sensitivity should have a disproportionate effect on population dynamics. For 
example, if a sensitivity analysis showed that adult fertility had the highest
sensitivity value then management actions that reduce adult fertility might be 
effective. There is a lot of behind the scenes matrix stuff but the various
functions in `popbio` to the work for us. Specifically we can use the following 
functions:

* `reproductive.value(A)` calculates reproductive value
* `stable.stage(A)` calculates stable stage distribution
* `sensitivity(A)` caluclates the sensitivity
* `elasticity(A)`  calculates the elasticity


```{r}
library(popbio)

reproductive.value(A_poor)
stable.stage(A_poor)
reproductive.value(A_intermediate)
stable.stage(A_intermediate)
reproductive.value(A_good)
stable.stage(A_good)

s_poor<-sensitivity(A_poor) # SENSITIVITY FOR MATRIX A
s_poor # sensitivity matrix
s_intermediate<-sensitivity(A_intermediate) # SENSITIVITY FOR MATRIX A
s_intermediate # sensitivity matrix
s_good<-sensitivity(A_good) # SENSITIVITY FOR MATRIX A
s_good # sensitivity matrix
```
What is going on with all those numbers? Some of the values were 0, so why is there 
as sensitivity value for them?

#### Elasticity: e

Elasticities take a sensitivity matrix and make the values proportional to the size
of the matrix value, which clears out the zero values and puts the resulting matrix
in terms of its effect on population growth rate. 

```{r}
e_poor<-elasticity(A_poor)
e_poor # elasticity matrix
e_intermediate<-elasticity(A_intermediate) 
e_intermediate # elasticity matrix
e_good<-elasticity(A_good) 
e_good # elasticity matrix
```
Now these matrices generally form management recommendations and so on that come
out of this type of work. But there are come issues here because conditions vary
over time and the underlying demographics do was well.

### Uncertainty in conditions

We can start to look at the effect of uncertainty in conditions using a stochastic
projection.

```{r}
out<-stoch.projection(
    matrices=list(A_poor,A_intermediate,
        A_good),
    n0 = c(3000,900, 800),
    tmax=100,
    nreps=5000,
    prob= c(0.35,0.35,0.30),
    nmax=100000) # cut off at 100k all stages

gr<-stoch.growth.rate(matrices=list(A_poor,A_intermediate,
        A_good), prob = c(0.35,0.35,0.30))  
gr        
```
The above code will give us some idea of the growth rate 

#### Implications for management

For the results the authors recommended the following 

1. hunting, as a measure to control populations, should be adjusted to 
changing environmental conditions (State dependent decision) 

2. Growing populations under good environmental conditions, particularly 
following a full mast of trees, yearly survival of juveniles should be 
reduced most, to approximately 15% (including natural postnatal 
mortality), assuming 60% survival in yearlings and 70% in adults, in 
order to limit growth rate to $\lambda \leq 1$ 

3. Our analysis shows that preferential hunting of adults in favourable 
habitats would be ineffective, because even if survival of adults was 
below 10% (assuming 50% survival in juveniles and 60% survival in 
yearlings) population growth would not drop to $\lambda = 1$ 

4. For poor environments, on the other hand, our elasticity analysis 
indicated that decreasing adult survival would lead to the most 
effective reduction of population growth 

_Questions_

1. As a decision maker how do you implement an action given these
recommendations?
2. How do you account for uncertainty?
3. Do recommendations from equilibrium analyses like this match
the temporal scale of management? 
4. It was recommended that when conditions are poor (harsh winter
poor acorn mast) managers should decrease
adult survival by some management action. However, initial conditions 
(i.e., how many pigs) _do not_ influence demographic
sensitivity and elasticity analyses. What do you do when there are only
a handful of adults around? Do you expend effort to decrease 
survival or should you adapt your decision to the current system state?
5. How do you incorporate management objectives.  


## Reframing as a decision model

Let's take this case study are try to recast it as a decision model. First we need
to set up the model and influence diagram. Let's start with [Pig.neta](pig.neta), which
for the sake of time has several nodes built in. You will notice nodes for the current
abundance and future abundance as well as a node for conditions as they influence the 
future population size by altering demographic rates. 

```{r}
n0<-N
F<-c(0.13,0.56,1.64) 
S<-c(0.25,0.31,0.58) 
   
yy<-c(sum(n0*F), # Juveniles
    n0[1]*S[1] , # Yearlings
    n0[2]*S[2]+n0[3]*S[3])# Adults
   
# COMPARE TO MATRIX CALCULATION
y<-A_poor %*% N 

cbind(y,yy)  # winner winner 
```
OK, we can use some conventional math to get the same dynamics and not have to 
use the matrix. This gives us some flexibility in simulations, specifically, we can 
add uncertainty. 

Now let's be good and acknowledge at least some uncertainty. There is most certainly
other bits of uncertainty at play (i.e., observation, structural) here but for sake of time we simply throw
some parametric uncertainty in the process using the `rpois()` and `rbinom()` functions
to simulate the number of juvenile, yearling, and adult pigs in the next year.

```{r}
n0<-N
F<-c(0.13,0.56,1.64) 
S<-c(0.25,0.31,0.58) 
   
yy<-c(sum(rpois(3,n0*F)), # Juveniles
   rbinom(1,n0[1],S[1]), # Yearlings
   rbinom(1,n0[2],S[2])+rbinom(1,n0[3],S[3]))# Adults
```
Now we can generalize the code above to do a big stochastic simulation 
to generate the many many outcomes. First we need to set up the fertility and
survivals a bit differently to efficiently simulate from.

```{r}

F_j=c(0.13,0.56,1.64)# poor, intermediate, good
F_y=c(0.56,0.94,1.93)
F_a =c(1.64,1.76,2.29)
        
S_j=c(0.25,0.31,0.58)
S_y=c(0.31,0.40,0.66)
S_a =c(0.58,0.60,0.71)       
```
Why did I do this? Well, `r` can handle vectors easily using brackets.
What I mean here is if i have a vector with 3 values in it, I can use that indexing to
make many many values. Let's demonstrate.

```{r}
x<- c(5,6,7)
# a vector of indices
indexes<- c(1,1,3,2,2,1,1)# 1,2,3 indexes condition
x[indexes] # EXPANDS X GIVEN THE INDEX
```
We did that so we can efficiently use the conditions to 
index the stage specific appropriate fertility and survival.
First we will set up the `data.frame()` with randomly selected 
conditions and initial abundances for each state.
```{r}
set.seed(8433)
reps<- 250000
outcomes<- data.frame(
    condition=sample(c(1:3),reps,replace=TRUE),
    n0_j=rpois(reps,N[1]),
    n0_y=rpois(reps,N[2]),
    n0_a= rpois(reps,N[3])) 
```
That gives us a 250k row of values.

```{r}
head(outcomes)
```
Now we can forecast the future abundance for each stage given the conditions.
Note that we are only doing this for 1 year. First we will forecast juveniles.

```{r}
outcomes$n1_j<-rpois(reps,outcomes$n0_j*F_j[outcomes$condition])+
    rpois(reps,outcomes$n0_y*F_y[outcomes$condition])+
    rpois(reps,outcomes$n0_a*F_a[outcomes$condition])
```
Now we can do yearling and adults.
```{r}
outcomes$n1_y<- rbinom(reps,outcomes$n0_j,S_j[outcomes$condition])  
outcomes$n1_a<- rbinom(reps,outcomes$n0_y,S_y[outcomes$condition])+
    rbinom(reps,outcomes$n0_a,S_a[outcomes$condition])
```

Like we did before, we discretize the outcomes to put in a decision 
model. First we need to summarize the output to make sure we discretize 
appropriately. 

```{r}
rngs<- apply(outcomes,2,range)

```
Looks like the range for `n0` was `r min(outcomes$n0_j)` 
to `r max(outcomes$n0_j)` for juveniles, 
`r min(outcomes$n0_y)` 
to `r max(outcomes$n0_y)` for yearlings, and  
`r min(outcomes$n0_a)` 
to `r max(outcomes$n0_a)` for adults. the future numbers were
`r min(outcomes$n1_j)` 
to `r max(outcomes$n1_j)` for juveniles, 
`r min(outcomes$n1_y)` 
to `r max(outcomes$n1_y)` for yearlings, and  
`r min(outcomes$n1_a)` 
to `r max(outcomes$n1_a)` for adults.


### Discretizing outcomes

Now we can discretize our outcomes for input into Netica.

Now we can discretize Juveniles using the `cut()` function.

```{r}
# Juveniles Initial Abundance
bins<- seq(0,150,length.out=5)
labs<- paste(bins[-length(bins)],bins[-1],sep="-")
outcomes$n0_j_bin<-cut(outcomes$n0_j,
    breaks=bins,
    labels=labs,
    include.lowest=TRUE)
# Juveniles Future Abundance
bins<- seq(0,500,length.out=5)
labs<- paste(bins[-length(bins)],bins[-1],sep="-")
outcomes$n1_j_bin<-cut(outcomes$n1_j,
    breaks=bins,
    labels=labs,
    include.lowest=TRUE) 
```

And Yearlings
    
```{r}
# Yearling Initial Abundance
bins<- seq(0,50,length.out=5)
labs<- paste(bins[-length(bins)],bins[-1], sep = "-")
outcomes$n0_y_bin<- cut(outcomes$n0_y,
    breaks=bins,
    labels=labs,
    include.lowest=TRUE)
# Yearling Future  Abundance
bins<- seq(0,90,length.out=5)
labs<- paste(bins[-length(bins)],bins[-1],sep="-")
outcomes$n1_y_bin<- cut(outcomes$n1_y,
    breaks=bins,
    labels=labs,
    include.lowest=TRUE) 
```

And now for adults

```{r}
# Adult Initial Abundance
bins<- seq(0,90,length.out=5)
labs<- paste(bins[-length(bins)],bins[-1],sep="-")
outcomes$n0_a_bin<- cut(outcomes$n0_a,
    breaks=bins,
    labels=labs,
    include.lowest=TRUE)  
# Adult Future  Abundance
bins<- seq(0,80,length.out=5)
labs<- paste(bins[-length(bins)],bins[-1],sep="-")
outcomes$n1_a_bin<- cut(outcomes$n1_a,
    breaks=bins,
    labels=labs,
    include.lowest=TRUE)
```

Here I will use the `prop.table()` function to quickly calculate the 
probability of each outcome. Recall before we used frequencies. Just a different
way to do the same thing.

```{r}
prop.table(table(outcomes$n0_j_bin))
prop.table(table(outcomes$n0_y_bin))
prop.table(table(outcomes$n0_a_bin))
```
And now we can do it for the future population given the current population size.

```{r}
library(reshape2) # for the dcast function
outcomes$tmp<-1 # a value to sum over for counts

future_juveniles<- dcast(data=outcomes, 
    formula=condition+n0_j_bin~n1_j_bin,
    value.var="tmp",
    fun.aggregate=sum,
    drop=FALSE)  
    
future_yearlings<- dcast(data=outcomes, 
    formula=condition+n0_y_bin~n1_y_bin,
    value.var="tmp",
    fun.aggregate=sum,
    drop=FALSE)  
    
future_adults<- dcast(data=outcomes, 
    formula=condition+n0_a_bin~n1_a_bin, 
    value.var="tmp",
    fun.aggregate=sum,
    drop=FALSE) 
```
Using the tables we can calculate the conditional probabilities of each outcome.
Notices the use of brackets and dropping the first 2 columns so I can calculate these 
correctly. 

```{r}
future_juveniles[,-c(1,2)]<- prop.table(as.matrix(future_juveniles[,-c(1,2)]),1)
future_yearlings[,-c(1,2)]<- prop.table(as.matrix(future_yearlings[,-c(1,2)]),1)
future_adults[,-c(1,2)]<- prop.table(as.matrix(future_adults[,-c(1,2)]),1)
```

Tada! The conditional probability tables.

```{r}
future_juveniles
future_yearlings
future_adults
write.csv(future_juveniles,"future_juveniles.csv")
```

Ok, now we are going to get into trying to cobble together a decision network for
this case study.
