## Course background and rational

Natural resource managers increasingly work with diverse stakeholder groups and
incorporate their values and objectives when developing management and conservation plans.
Such decisions are fraught with the complexity and uncertainty associated with
ecological system dynamics and multiple and potentially conflicting objectives
under consideration. Structured decision making (SDM) is an approach that can
incorporate multiple competing objectives and ecological uncertainties in a framework
that is transparent and adaptable. It also is an ideal framework for interdisciplinary
management teams to cooperate and create the most effective management strategies.
The Department of the Interior (DOI) has recognized the importance of SDM and has
directed DOI bureaus and offices to incorporate SDM and adaptive management strategies
into their land and resource management decision making. However, there are few courses
on SDM and adaptive management available to students in natural resources and related
fields.  This course is intended to provide graduate students from diverse backgrounds
(natural resources, ecological economics, civil engineering, political science,
and others) with an understanding of the SDM process used for making natural
resource management and conservation decisions regardless of the level of complexity
or uncertainty.  Primary focus is exposing students to the logic and conceptual basis
of each step of the SDM process to understand when an SDM process is appropriate and
how the process produces and optimal decision when properly implemented to a natural
resource management or conservation problem. 


## Course objectives

The class materials are intended to develop the skills needed to create basic
decision models for predicting the outcomes of management actions.
The culmination of this course is the course project where students are required
to integrate the skills.  By the end of this course, all students should be able to:

1. Recognize and incorporate different stakeholder viewpoints into decision making 
2. Work effectively with stakeholder groups using an SDM approach and recognize and
ameliorate impediments to the process 
3. Identify and classify stakeholder objectives and create diagrams representing
their relationships 
4. Quantify stakeholder objectives and identify measurable outcomes from natural 
resource decisions  
5. Use the structured decision making process to work through a management problem
with rapid-prototyping methods 
6. Create and interpret graphical models of natural resource decisions 
7. Use ecological methods to estimate current state conditions and integrate
decision-making with monitoring
8. Use models to predict likely outcomes and associated uncertainties
9. Identify the different types of uncertainty and understand how each can be
represented in a model 
10. Use adaptive management to reduce system uncertainty and improve future decisions 
11. Understand and describe the principles of structured decision making and
adaptive management 

## Academic misconduct

Academic integrity is serious and all disciplinary action will be taken in the event
of academic dishonesty.  Mississippi State has an approved Honor Code that applies
to all students. The code is as follows: "As a Mississippi State University student,
I will conduct myself with honor and integrity at all times. I will not lie, cheat,
or steal, nor will I accept the actions of those who do." Upon accepting admission to
Mississippi State University, a student immediately assumes a commitment to uphold the
Honor Code, to accept responsibility for learning, and to follow the philosophy and
rules of the Honor Code. Student will be required to state their commitment on
examinations, research papers, and other academic work. Ignorance of the rules does
not exclude any member of the MSU community from the requirements or the processes
of the Honor Code. For additional information, please visit:
http://honorcode.msstate.edu/policy.


## Cell Phone Policy

In accordance with Academic Operating Policy 10.08 (approved July 12, 2005) and
in order to limit classroom disruptions, as well as to protect against academic
misconduct, the use by students of cell phones, messaging devices and other
electronic devices is prohibited. In this class, students are required to put
cell phone in the silent mode and stow in backpack while attending class and
laboratory sessions. 

## Professional Expectations for Students in the Wildlife, Fisheries and Aquaculture Program 

http://www.cfr.msstate.edu/wildlife/documents/professional_expectations.pdf

## Assessment of student progress

Student performance will be based on weekly assignments (50%; 50 total points;
10 assignments each worth 5 points), a small group project that involves the
development and evaluation of a model to inform a natural resource management
or conservation decision (40%; 40 total points), and presentation of the small
group project to the class (10%; 10 total points).  Total assessment points equal 100.  


1. Homework problem sets (50 points). During the course you will be given
homework exercises to reinforce course topics and assess student progress.
There will be 10 homework exercises worth 5 points each.
All homework due 1 week from date assigned unless otherwise specified.
2. Final project report (40 points). The course project is intended to evaluate
the studentâ€™s ability to synthesize the individual course elements and create a
decision model to predict the outcomes of alternative natural resource management actions.
To complete the course project, each student group will choose a unique natural resource
management issue and will create a model that will be used to identify the optimal
management action. The model can correspond to the topic chosen for the group project
in the lecture portion of the course or can be a unique management or conservation issue
of interest. The instructor must approve of the topic before the project is initiated.
Each group will write a final report describing the model in detail including: the
data sources, justification for including individual model components and their relations,
results of sensitivity analysis, and the optimal management decision.
Project will be graded based on the appropriateness of the decision, how well students
described and justified the model structure, and the results and interpretation of
sensitivity analysis.  An example of a final report will be available on Blackboard
along with a detailed report scoring rubric outlining expectations.  
3. Presentation (10 points). During the final exam period you will be required
to present the details of your project as a 30 minute oral presentation.  


## Summary of evaluations:

Task (Points)
Homework problem sets (50 Points (10 exercises x 5 points per exercise))
Project report (40 Points)
Report presentation (10 Points)
*Total (100 Points)*

## Grading Scale

A= 90 to 100  	B = 80 to 89.9		C = 70 to 79.9		D = 69.9 to 69.9
F = 0 to 59.9

## Late assignment policy
Late assignments and missed exams: All assignments must be turned in on time.
Late assignments may be graded, but the maximum point value will be reduced by 10%
for every day the assignment is late; however, assignments will not be graded if
they are turned in after assignments grades are posted on blackboard.
If for some reason there is a timing conflict associated with a course due date,
discuss these conflicts with me at least two weeks prior to the scheduled date.

## Class attendance
Missed classes & laboratories: If you need to miss class for an 
excusable reason notify me in advance. I will not be 
responsible for providing content to students who missed class or 
laboratory without a qualified excuse and prior notification. 

Qualifying excused absences: 
Potential qualifying excuses for missed classes, laboratories, or 
lecture fall under 3 categories: 

1. Illness or other physical injury. I recognize you cannot control 
these and if you are sick by all means get better. If you anticipate 
requiring some makeup of lecture material, laboratory, or exam an excuse 
from the doctor is required. 
2. Emergency or accident. Again these are uncontrollable instances and 
these will be reviewed on a case by case basis between the student and 
instructor. Instances of work duties, meeting the cable person, or other 
similar circumstances do not constitute emergencies. 
3. Unique work experience. There are instances where unique work and 
research experiences do occur that will require you to miss class, 
laboratories, or exams. These are likely to be known well in advance and 
therefore the same 2 week late assignment policy applies here. These 
instances will be reviewed on a case by case basis. Missing class 
elements to perform your typical work duties do not apply, however some 
work instances may fit (e.g., a weeklong trip to sample critters on the 
coast) and are best discussed with the instructor at least 2 weeks prior 
to the event. 
4. Field work, scientific, and stakeholder meeting obligations. We are 
all busy with research and various aspects of our day to day operations
and at times these may conflict with class. These conflicts are reasonable 
qualifications to miss class.
