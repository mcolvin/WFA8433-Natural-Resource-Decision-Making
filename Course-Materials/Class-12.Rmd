Email to me: michael.colvin@msstate.edu, only 1 per group needed.
* Link to class recording  [Pending]()
* Today's R script [Class-12.R](scripts/Class-12.R)

## Objectives 

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to:

1. Understand generalized linear models (GLMs)
1. Understand logit and expit link functions
2. Predicting outcomes from GLMs
2. Using analysis in decision contexts


## Some preliminaries

* If you want to play along in class download this zipfile 
[*.zip](http://mec685.cfr.msstate.edu/class-12.zip). 
* Be sure to unzip it before trying to use files and such
* The file contains the dataset used in class and an R script of all the 
code. 
* Once you have it where you want open the R script and be sure to check 
the working directory `getwd()` and make sure it is where your folder 
is. 
* If your working directory is not correct, you can set it in Rstudio: 
"Session --> Set Working Directory --> To source file location". Or you 
can use the `setwd()` in the console. 



```{r}
dat<- read.csv("transport-mortality-data.csv")
```

Take a look at the first couple of rows again and get a feel for what we 
are looking at. 

```{r}
head(dat)
```

OK, looks like it did last class, that is good. Recall we need to 
calculate the number of mortalities for the GLM to work correctly. That 
is done below. 

```{r}
dat$n_mortalities<- dat$n_translocated-dat$n_survived
```

Now we can fit the model assuming the data has a binomial distribution. 
Recall the prediction model was: 


$$\text{logit}(p) = \beta_{0}+
    \beta_{1}\cdot\text{Temperature}+
    \beta_{2}\cdot\text{Truck}+
    \beta_{3}\cdot\text{Temperature}\cdot\text{Truck}$$

    
where

* $\beta_{0}$ is the intercept of the linear model  
* $\beta_{1}$ is the effect of temperature
* $\beta_{2}$ is the effect of truck
* $\beta_{3}$ is the interaction of temperature and truck, and
* $p$ is the predicted survival
 
And the statistical model linking the observed data to the linear model 
was: 


$$\text{Number Survived}\sim Binomial(\text{Number Translocated},p)$$    


where,

* $\text{Number Survived}$ is the number of critters surviving 
translocation 
* $\text{Number Translocated}$ is the number of critters translocated 
* $p$ is the probability of success (i.e., survival) 

```{r}
fit<-glm(cbind(n_survived,n_mortalities)~temperature+truck+temperature:truck,
    data=dat, family="binomial")
```

We left off in the last class with using the `rbinom()` function to 
simulate many realizations of the binomial distribution given a number 
of critters to translocate and the probability of surviving. We made a 
new object `combos` using the `expand.grid()` function to generate all 
possible combinations of temperature, number of critters to translocate, 
and which truck. That code is below. 

```{r}
combos<- expand.grid(
    temperature=c(8,10,12,14),
    ntranslocate=c(100,250,500,1000),
    truck=c("truck 1","truck 2"))
head(combos) # look at the combos
```    

Recall we used the`predict()` function to make predictions from the 
fitted model and we specific that that `type="response"` and not 
`type="link"` because we want the actual probabilities and not the log 
odds (i.e., logit). Also recall that we could not get prediction 
intervals using the `predict()` function for a `glm()` but as we saw 
last time the we can pretty closely approximate it by simply simulating 
from the distribution. If we really really wanted to we could bootstrap 
it but that would take some time! The code below fits the `glm()` to the 
data assuming the data is binomially distributed. 
 
```{r}
combos$S<- predict(fit, # predict survival for each input combination
    newdata=combos,
    type="response")
```

Now that we have the predicted survival we can simulate the expected outcomes 
for each combination. In this example the outcomes are the number of critters that
survive the translocation.  Now, we had `r nrow(combos)` possible combinations to 
evaluate and as you recall we need to generate many values from `rbinom()` to begin
to approximate the true distribution.  Fortunately computers are good at this type of 
things so let's give it a go. 

First we need an object to hold all our values. A matrix will work well
because I can preallocate it and fill it with 0s. Let's do 10,000 replicates
for each combo, so we will need a matrix with `r nrow(combos)` and 10,000
columns to hold each replicate! The rows in the matrix correspond to each row
in the `combos` `data.frame()`.

Let's make that matrix.

```{r}
nsims<- 10000
outcomes<- matrix(0, # fill with 0s
    nrow=nrow(combos), # number of rows
    ncol=nsims) # number of columns
```

Now that we have it made we can fill each row with replicate draws from 
the binomial distribution given how many critters we want to translocate
and the predicted survival. We are going to use the for `for()` function to
loop over each row of `combos` and extract the predicted survival and number
of critters to translocate to use as inputs to `rbinom()`.

```{r}
for(i in 1:nrow(combos))
    {
    S<- combos$S[i]
    Nt<- combos$ntranslocate[i]
    outcomes[i,]<-rbinom(nsims,Nt, S)
    }
```   

Now that is done we can look at the outcomes using hist. Below are the expectations for 
the 32nd combination. 

```{r}
hist(outcomes[32,])  
```

And we can calculate the probability of each outcome.

```{r}
table(outcomes[32,])/nsims
```

Now, there are quite a few possible outcomes. The number of survivors 
varies from `r min(outcomes)` to `r max(outcomes)`. If we put that together as a
decision tree, it would start with 32 branches and have an additional `r max(outcomes)-min(outcomes)`
outcomes for each of those branches. Take it from me, it will be a big tree!
If you are bored, make that tree and hang it on your fridge.

### A decision model

Fortunately a tool like Netica and help out here.  We take the predictive model and 
statistical model an implement them in Netica to develop a formal decision making process.
In this context we might be interest in which truck to use to translocate our critters
so we maximize survival. This model looks like the image below.



```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("media/cl12-translocation-network.png")
```

There is a whole lot being consolidated into 4 nature notes!
Let's dig a bit deeper into this. The part of the model below 
highlights the predictive model. Recall it was 


$$\text{logit}(p) = \beta_{0}+
    \beta_{1}\cdot\text{Temperature}+
    \beta_{2}\cdot\text{Truck}+
    \beta_{3}\cdot\text{Temperature}\cdot\text{Truck}$$

    
where

* $\beta_{0}$ is the intercept of the linear model  
* $\beta_{1}$ is the effect of temperature
* $\beta_{2}$ is the effect of truck
* $\beta_{3}$ is the interaction of temperature and truck, and
* $p$ is the predicted survival

The BDN below shows the inputs temperature and truck as predicting
survival.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("media/cl12-translocation-network-02.png")
```

But I don't see where the $\beta$s are? I mean I fit the model and 
all, so how are they used to predict survival? Well that is because I was able
to specify the equation in Netica, it is not pretty but it is pretty doable if you 
do it in chunks.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
include_graphics("media/cl12-translocation-network-02a.png")
```

The dialog box specifies what survival is depending on temperature and what truck is used!

In the figure below we have that statistical model highlighted. Recall it was
$$\text{Number Survived}\sim Binomial(\text{Number Translocated},p)$$    

where,

* $\text{Number Survived}$ is the number of critters surviving 
translocation 
* $\text{Number Translocated}$ is the number of critters translocated 
* $p$ is the probability of success (i.e., survival) 

Well that seems to jive with the inputs below!  Cool beans.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("media/cl12-translocation-network-03.png")
```

Just like with survival there is an equation that calculates the probability 
of the outcomes, number surviving, given survival and the number of critters to translocate.

```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="45%"}
include_graphics("media/cl12-translocation-network-03a.png")
```

Hopefully this has you thinking that you might be able to find information
that can link to the temperature node, for example, you might be able to 
use information on the average temperature from the day before to predict whate
the temperature might be.  As we move along we will actually look at a way of 
quantifying how valuable that information might be. But for now we will 
return to leaning about 2 more GLMs as these are important tools to link system
states (inputs) to expected outcomes.

### Bernoulli

The next distributional family we will look at is the Bernoulli which
is very similar to the binomial. You can think of it as a binomial but with
only 1 trial and therefore the outcomes are restricted to 0 and 1. We see this
distribution in ecology associated with quantities that can be one of 2 possible
outcomes such as

* Present or absent
* Infected or uninfected
* Mature or immature
* Male or female

you get the drift. Each outcome above can be coded as a 0 or 1 and the probability
of being a 0 or 1 modeled using a linear model. Specifically the model is:
the predictive model was: 


$$\text{logit}(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_i\cdot X_i $$ 

where 


* $\beta_{0}$ is the model intercept, 
* $\beta_{i}$ is the effect of covariate $i$, 
* $X_i$ is a matrix of predictor covariates 
* $i$ indexes each covariate.


The link the prediction to data using a statistical model to 
account for uncertainty as: 


$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p)$$


* $Y_i$ is the observed values
* $p$ is the probability of success (i.e., 1)

Now this should look very familiar to the Binomial model we worked with in the 
last class. In fact, $Bernoulli(p) = Binomial(1,p)$! Don't believe me? Let's verify it 
with a quick simulation. Let's try simulating a probability of success of 0.3.

Using the binomial we can simulation 100 outcomes using the code below.

```{r}
success<- rbinom(n=100,size=1,prob=0.3)
```
If all went to plan there should be about 30 success. Let's confirm

```{r}
table(success)
```
Nice, about 30 successes were returned per 100 independent trials.

Now there is no corresponding `rbernoulli()` or `rbern()` function in 
R because they are the same as `rbinom()` with `size=1`.


#### The data

Continuing with our translocation example from before, suppose after 
translocation the population was monitored to see if the translocation 
was successful. In this case success was defined as detecting 2 
reproductive critters one year post translocation. 

There are some factors that likely influence whether the translocation 
was successful. For example, if you translocate more critters then you 
are more likely to have a successful translocation. Also, the previous 
example looked at short term mortality of translocation using the 
binomial, however there may be delayed effects due to stressful 
conditions encountered during the translocation event. 

The data below represents data that one would expect if a conservation 
translocation operation had been operating for a while. Actually, the 
data matches up to our previous dataset. Except we have a couple of new 
columns of data. The first column specifies whether that translocation 
was successful or not, 1 or 0 respectively. Also included in the dataset 
is the habitat type where the critters were released which has 3 levels: 
forest, field, and swamp. 

```{r,echo=FALSE}
b<- c(1,-0.02,0.002,-0.0008)
set.seed(8433)
dat<- data.frame(temperature=round(runif(200,3,13),1),
    truck=sample(c("truck 1","truck 2"),200,replace=TRUE))
dat$n_translocated<- floor(runif(200,200,1000) )   

mm<- model.matrix(as.formula("~temperature+truck+temperature:truck"),
    data=dat)
dat$y<- mm %*% b
dat$S<-plogis(dat$y)

dat$n_survived<- dat$n_translocated-rbinom(200,dat$n_translocated,plogis(dat$y))
#dat$p<- dat$n_survived/dat$n_translocated
dat<-dat [,-c(4,5)]
dat$habitat<- as.factor(sample(c("forest","field","swamp"),nrow(dat),replace=TRUE))

mm<- model.matrix(as.formula("~habitat+n_survived + truck "),dat)
betas<- c(-5,-1.8,-0.4,0.03,-1.5)
y<- plogis(mm %*% betas)

dat$success<- rbinom(nrow(dat),1,y)
write.csv(dat,"translocation-success-data.csv",row.names=FALSE)
```


```{r}
dat<- read.csv("translocation-success-data.csv")
```
As usual let's take a look at the data and make sure things are ok.

```{r}
head(dat)
str(dat)
```
Things look good we have a new factor for `habitat` and a field for `success`.

We can look at the data with our plot function. Let's see if we can see 
anything with success. 


```{r}
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success")
```
Well that was not very helpful. But it does show that we do not have to 
deal with complete separation issues. I know you are all probably 
thinking separation issues only occur when you are away from your 
computer for too long, but in this case if there is no overlap between 
the 0s and 1s with the covariate we will not be able to fit the model. 

Let's try to look at each habitat on a plot. We can use the subset 
argument in the plot function to look at each habitat. To keep them all 
straight I am going to add a title to them. 


```{r}
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="forest",
    main="Forest")
```
Now lets look at field habitat.

```{r}
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="field",
    main="Field")
```
And finally we can look at swamp.

```{r}
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="swamp",
    main="Swamp")
```

Let's use our points function to overlay the different habitat types. 
First we make a blank plot using the argument `type="n"` and then 
overlay our varying habitats using the `points()` function. 




```{r}
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    type="n")
points(success~n_survived,data=dat,
      subset=habitat=="forest",
      col="blue")
points(success~n_survived,data=dat,
      subset=habitat=="field",
      col="red")
points(success~n_survived,data=dat,
      subset=habitat=="swamp",
      col="green")
```

Well that is not super helpful either.

Can we plot multiple panels on the same plot? Yes, I am gladd you asked. 
We can use the `par()` function to tell `R` to plot several plots on the 
same plot area. Specifically, the `mfrow` argument will allow us to specify
how many row and columns to plot. Let's make each plot in 3 rows and 1 column.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(3,1))
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="forest")
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="field")
 plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="swamp")  
```

Well we can start to see some patterns here.
Forest looks to be only successful if there are lots of critters translocated.
swampy areas have success over a wide range of numbers stocked.

Those plots are hard to read though. With some tweaking we can 
adjust things to make them a bit more pleasant. First thing we need
to adjust is the margins around each plot using the `mar` argument

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(3,1),mar=c(1,1,1,1))
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="forest")
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="field")
 plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="swamp")  
```

Well that is better, but I lost my labels. What do the 4 numbers mean anyways?
Well they indicate the margin size starting at the bottom (x-axis) and move 
clockwise around so that 2 is the y-axis, 3 is the top, and 4 is the left margin.
If was want to increase the bottom and right margins a bit we can change the first
and second element in the `mar` argument.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(3,1),mar=c(6,6,1,1))
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="forest")
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="field")
 plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="Number survived",
    ylab="Translocation success",
    subset=habitat=="swamp")  
```

That is better, but my axis labels are gross and redundant.
We can add a little bit of outer margin and add some text to that
to make them not so gross using the `oma` argument. And we can then
use the `mtext()` function to add some text in that new margin area.

```{r}
par(mfrow=c(3,1),mar=c(1,1,1,1),oma=c(3,3,1,1))
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="",
    ylab="",
    subset=habitat=="forest")
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="",
    ylab="",
    subset=habitat=="field")
plot(success~n_survived,data=dat,
    xlab="",
    ylab="",
    subset=habitat=="swamp")  
mtext(text="Number survived",
    side=1,# plot on the bottom outer margin
    line=1,# what line to plot on 
    outer=TRUE) # plot in the outer margin
mtext(text="Translocation success",
    side=2, # plot on the left outer margin
    line=1, # what line to plot on 
    outer=TRUE) # plot in the outer margin
```

With tweaking you can get some really good graphics. Let's move on to
the model.

#### model

Here we are going to fit a model to the 0s and 1s, success in the 
dataset. Specifically we are going to fit the predictive model


$$\text{logit}(p) = \beta_0 + \beta_1\cdot \text{Survivors} + 
    \beta_2\cdot\text{Truck} +
    \beta_3\cdot\text{Habitat}$$ 

where 

* $\beta_{0}$ is the model intercept, 
* $\beta_{1}$ is the effect of the number of critters translocated 
* $\beta_{2}$ is the effect of truck indicating a delayed mortality
* $\beta_{3}$ is the effect of habitat the critter was stocked into

The link the prediction to data using a statistical model to 
account for uncertainty as: 


$$Y_i \sim Bernoulli(p)$$

where

* $Y_i$ is the observed values
* $p$ is the probability of translocation success (i.e., 1)

#### fitting

We fit that model as before using the`glm()` function.

```{r}
fit<- glm(success~n_survived+truck+habitat,
    data=dat,
    family="binomial")
```

In this case we did not have to use the `cbind()` function to bind the 
successes and failures together, the function interpreted the 0s as 
failures and the 1s as successes for us. We can do all the cool things 
as before like using `summary()`, `coef()`, and so on. 


```{r}
summary(fit)
```

We have a nice summary of the effects and the estimates of the $\beta$s. 
We can extract those. 



```{r}
betas<- coef(fit)
```
The summary provides p-values, which are nice, but some analysis prefer 
confidence intervals of the parameter estimates. We can calculate those 
using the `confint()` function. 



```{r}
confint(fit)
```
This approach profiles the likelihood, see Hilborn and Mangel's 
Ecological Detective if you are interested in this. Regardless we can 
see most estimates are reasonably precise and do not overlap 0. Habitat 
is a bit suspect, but we are going to roll with it. 


We can get things like residuals and fitted values.

```{r}
dat$residuals<- resid(fit)
dat$fitted<- fitted(fit)
```
And now we can look at them.

```{r}
plot(residuals~fitted,
    data=dat)
```
Well that is weird, but it illustrates there only 2 outcomes, 0 or 1. 
The plot of predicted to observed is equally weird and not really any 
use. 


```{r}
plot(success~fitted,
    data=dat)
```
 The take home here is that it is difficult to evaluate binary outcomes, 
but you can look at things like receiver operator curves to see if the 
model does better than chance and other goodness of fit measures..

#### Predictions

We can make predictions just as we did before using the `predict()` function.
First we need to make a dataset to predict from. The `expand.grid()` function
worked well before to get all possible combinations, let's use that again.

```{r}
preddat<- expand.grid(
    truck=c("truck 1", "truck 2"),
    n_survived=c(min(dat$n_survived):max(dat$n_survived)),
    habitat=c("forest","field","swamp"))
head(preddat)
```
And then feed the new data to the `predict()` function.

```{r}
preddat$pred<- predict(fit, newdata=preddat,
    type="response")# get probabilities, not log odds
```

To help visualize what is going on we can plot the prediction.

```{r}
plot(pred~n_survived,preddat,type="n",
    xlab="Number surviving",
    ylab="Probability of success",
    las=1)
points(pred~n_survived,preddat,
    subset=truck=="truck 1" & habitat =="forest",
    lty=1,type="l")
points(pred~n_survived,preddat,
    subset=truck=="truck 2" & habitat =="forest",
    lty=2,type="l")    
points(pred~n_survived,preddat,
    subset=truck=="truck 1" & habitat =="field",
    lty=1,col="darkgrey",type="l")
points(pred~n_survived,preddat,
    subset=truck=="truck 2" & habitat =="field",
    lty=2,col="darkgrey",type="l")      
 points(pred~n_survived,preddat,
    subset=truck=="truck 1" & habitat =="swamp",
    lty=1,col="lightgrey",type="l")
points(pred~n_survived,preddat,
    subset=truck=="truck 2" & habitat =="swamp",
    lty=2,col="lightgrey",type="l")    
# PUT A LEGEND ON THIS AND CALL IT A NIGHT!    
legend("topleft",c("Forest Truck 1","Forest Truck 2",
    "Field Truck 1","Field Truck 2",
    "Swamp Truck 1","Swamp Truck 2"),
    col=c("black","black",
        "darkgrey","darkgrey",
        "lightgrey","lightgrey"),lty=c(1,2))
```

One nice thing about the binomial is that we can directly 
interpret the outcomes. 

```{r}
preddat[preddat$n_survived==200,]
```
Looks like the effect of truck 2 is pretty significant. We can also add 
our new model to our existing decision network, like the figure below. 


```{r echo=FALSE, out.width="95%"}
include_graphics("media/cl12-translocation-network-04.png")
```
