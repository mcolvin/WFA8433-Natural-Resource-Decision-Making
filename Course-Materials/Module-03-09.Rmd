# Estimating current states (marked populations): survival & abundance
<!--
## For next class

TBD


## Learning objectives

1. Objective 1
2. Objective 2


# Comments

* single season multi state assumes that if a history like 102 occurs the first state was misclassified and the true
 stat is 2
* Gonna need a robust design to actually get at the transition probabilities.

```{r}

M <- 250 # Number of sites
J <- 3 # num secondary sample periods
T <- 10 # num primary sample periods

muZ <- z <- array(dim = c(M, T)) # Expected and realized occurrence
y <- array(NA, dim = c(M, J, T)) # Detection histories
set.seed(13973)

gamma <- runif(n=T-1, min=0.1, max=0.2) # Colonization probability
# Generate latent states of occurrence
# First year
