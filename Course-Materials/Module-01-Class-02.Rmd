The Madeline Hunter "seven step lesson plan." The basic lesson plan outline
given above contains the so-called "Hunter direct instruction lesson plan
elements:" 
1) objectives, 
2) standards, 
3) anticipatory set, 
4) teaching [input, modeling, and check for understanding], 
5) guided practice, 
6) closure, and 
7) independent practice. 
If you count input, modeling, and check for understanding as three steps,
there are nine elements...not the seven in the usual title.
Madeline Hunter did not create a seven step lesson plan model. She suggested
various elements that might be considered in planning for effective instruction. 
In practice, these elements were compiled by others as the "Seven Step Lesson 
Plan, "taught through teachers inservice, and used as a check list of items that
must be contained in each lesson.
