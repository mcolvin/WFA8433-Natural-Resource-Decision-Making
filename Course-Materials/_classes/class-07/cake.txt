They came up with these, you know, just-add-water mixes to make your angel food cake or whatever it was, and consumers rejected them. They felt that it was cheating to make cake from a mix. And the marketers studied the problem and tried to figure out how could they persuade women to accept these cakes. And then they figured out that if they left something for women to do - and in this case it was cracking open an egg instead of having dehydrated eggs in the mix -that giving them that act would allow them to feel like they had actually cooked that cake.

So there's been a kind of defining downward of what it means to actually cook from scratch, and a lot of people will feel that, you know, using a cake mix is cooking from scratch. And compared to opening up a pack of Twinkies, I guess it is.
