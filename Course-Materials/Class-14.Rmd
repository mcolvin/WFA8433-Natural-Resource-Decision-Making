# Class 15. GLMMs  and HLMs in Decision Contexts Part 

* Supplemental background reading(s):
    * ???
* Assignment due: None
* Link to class recording  [YouTube]()
* Today's R script [Class-14.R](scripts/Class-14.R)

## Objectives 

By the end of this tutorial you should be able to:

1. Understand generalized linear models (GLMs)
1. Understand log link function
1. Predicting outcomes from a GLM assuming a Poisson distribution
1. Understand offsets and overdispersion 
1. Using analysis in decision contexts to predict counts


## Preliminaries

* If you want to play along in class download th
    * ????
* Be sure to unzip it before trying to use files and such
* The file contains the dataset used in class and an R script of all the 
code. 
* Once you have it where you want open the R script and be sure to check 
the working directory `getwd()` and make sure it is where your folder 
is. 
* If your working directory is not correct, you can set it in Rstudio: 
"Session --> Set Working Directory --> To source file location". Or you 
can use the `setwd()` in the console.
