## Learning objectives

1. Objective 1
2. Objective 2


# There will be challenges

# Challenges

1. Communication
2. Stakeholder involvement
3. Data-too little, too much
4. Finite resources


# 1. Communications

# 1. Communications

# 1. Communications

'I think the inefficiency comes via a lack of communication and a lack
of a central program within which everyone works.' J. Nichols

# 2. Stakeholder involvement

## Stakeholders are interested

# Stakeholders Increasingly Interested & Judicious

# Consider alternative management

# Managers need to make decisions that are transparent & repeatable

# Black box management

# Managers have a model, even if they don’t realize it
Mental models
- Increase habitat & population will increase
- Increase harvest & population will compensate

# Unstated assumptions

# 3. Data limitations

Fisheries biologist never complain about collecting too much data—Dr. Joe Bonneau

- What do we do with the data?
- Is it collected to meet objectives?
- How is it incorporated into management?

# Many times data are not collected in a way that can be used to make a decision

“sites were statistically
different"

# Formalize learning from data collected?

Make smarter 
decisions…

# 4. Finite resources

How do we prioritize monitoring?
How do we prioritize research?
If something has to be cut what should it be?
Will it impact decision making & management?

# Managers need to do more with less & prioritize monitoring & research in a way that contributes to management decisions

# Managers need to figure out how to best allocate finite resources
